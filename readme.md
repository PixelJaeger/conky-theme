Original Theme by "wekers" -> https://github.com/wekers/conky<br>
<br>
Since i can not get the LUA scripting to work i modified the script to fit to my needs/liking.<br>
It _(!)should(!)_ work by just typing "conky -c /path/to/this/file"<br>
<br>
Remeber to change "wlp2s0" or "eno1" to YOUR Network-Interface<br>
<br>
all credits go to wekers<br>

Notes:<br>
1. Yes, i know that the "Up $value" and "Down $value" are switched in comparison to the graphs above them. I'm just too lazy to fix that right now
2. The whole theme was made for my Laptop with a max resolution of 1440 by 1080. So if you use it on anything "better" it's gonna be small. Workaround: use bigger text and/or add spaces between the categories.
3. For security reasons i blacked out parts of my WAN-IP and IPV6. It works nonetheless.
