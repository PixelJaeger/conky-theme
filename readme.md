Original Theme by "wekers" -> https://github.com/wekers/conky<br>
<br>
Since i can not get the LUA scripting to work i modified the script to fit to my needs/liking.<br>
It _(!)should(!)_ work by just typing "conky -c /path/to/this/file"<br>
<br>
Remeber to change "wlp2s0" or "eno1" to YOUR Network-Interface<br>
